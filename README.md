Machine learning-based NLP model for classifying philosophical currents from text. A NetRiders' production.

## Script execution
All the scripts provided must be run from the main folder (ProjectAtena)

All the packages required to run the scripts are written in requirements.txt

All the notebooks should be already executed

If some files require pretrained/fine-tuned model to run and those file are not foud some errors will be generated. All of these files are present in those specified folders on the remote machine for the course of HLT 23/24

To execute the code is essential to have the Philosophy data-set in the main directory (ProjectAtena)
